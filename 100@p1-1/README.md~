# Assignment 1: Implementing PageRank

PageRank is a popular graph algorithm used for information
retrieval and was first popularized as an algorithm powering
the Google search engine. Details of the PageRank algorithm will be
discussed in class. Here, you will implement several functions that
implement the PageRank algorithm in Racket.

Hints: 

- For this assignment, you may assume that no graph will include
any "self-links" (pages that link to themselves) and that each page
will link to at least one other page.

- you can use the code in `testing-facilities.rkt` to help generate
test input graphs for the project. The test suite was generated
using those functions.

- You may want to define "helper functions" to break up complicated
function definitions.

# (graph? g)

This program accepts graphs as input. Graphs are represented as a list
of links, where each link is a list `(,src ,dst) that signals page src
links to page dst.  This function checks whether a value is a valid
graph (-> any? boolean?).

# (pagerank? p).
