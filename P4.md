CIS352 Class Project 4 by Yuhao Chen
In this post, I will introduce an important featuer in C++ when dealing with inheritence -- **upcasting**
I will introduce some basic concepts step by step and work you through some code examples.
The post will include the following content

## Introduction to class in C++
Inherientance is an important feature for most object-oriented programming languages, including C++, Java ...
Before talking about inheritance, I need to briefly introduce how the object (class) is defined in C++
I define the following class Animal
```
class Animal {
public:
	int id;
	void who() { cout << "I'm an animal with ID " << id << endl; }
	Animal() { id = 0; }
	Animal(int id) { this->id = id; }
};
```
The Animal classs has one variable id, and one function who(). Both of them are public.
Also, I defined the constructors of the class.
In this main function, I will show you how to use this class.
```
int main() {

	Animal* A1 = new Animal(1);
	cout << A1->id << endl;
	A1->who();
}
```
For the above main(), it will create a pointer to the Animal class A1, and  it points to a Animal class initialized with member variable id=1
Then, I will print out the id , and call the function who() defined in the class.
The following is the output

> 1
I'm an animal with ID 1

## Inheritance in C++
Inheritance is a way to interite some variables, functions from base class to derived class.
You may not be familiar with **base class** and **derived class**
Don't worry! I will give you the definitions first and show you what they are in the examples
- Base Class: A class from which other classes are derived
- Derived Class: A class that is created from an existing class.
(reference from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-base-class-and-derived-class-in-c/)

I will show you some examples
```
class Animal {
public:
	int id;
	void who() { cout << "I'm an animal with ID " << id << endl; }
	Animal() { id = 0; }
	Animal(int id) { this->id = id; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {

public:
	string DogName;
	Dog() { DogName = "N/A"; id = 0; }
	Dog(string name) { DogName = name; }
	Dog(string name, int id) { DogName = name; this->id = id; }
	void bark() { cout << "I'm a Dog " << DogName << ", woof!woof!" << endl; }
};
```
For the above codes, Animal is **base class**, and Dog is **derived class**. 
Dog class public inheritances all the variables and functions from Animal class, and I defined some additional variables and functions in the derived class (Dog).

> We use public inheritance to simplify the example. If you are interested, I can write about the differences between public/static/private inheritance in the future post. 🙂

Now, I will show how to use derived class in the main function
```
int main() {

	Animal* A1 = new Animal(1);
	cout << A1->id << endl;
	A1->who();
	Dog D1("Mike", 55);
	cout << D1.DogName << endl;
	D1.bark();
	cout << D1.id << endl;
	D1.who();
}
```
I constructed an instance of the derived class Dog, with some variables DogName="Mike", id=55

Then, I will not only print out the variable and function defined in the Dog class, but also I will print out the variable id in the base class (Animal), and call function who() in the base class.

Here is the output
>Mike
>I'm a Dog Mike, woof!woof!
>55
>I'm an animal with ID 55

You can see the instance of derived class can also get access to all the public variables and functions in the base class.

## Upcasting in C++
Finally, let's talk about the upcasting in C++.
The boring definition will be
**Upcasting** is converting a derived-class reference or pointer to a base-class.
Reference from [BogoToBoGo](https://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/upcasting_downcasting.php)

What the definition means is that we can change the type from **pointer to the derived class** to **pointer to base class**.

The following is an example
```
int main() {
	Dog* D1 = new Dog("Mike", 55);
	Animal* A2 = static_cast<Animal*>(&D1);
	A2->who();
}
```
Firstly I create a pointer to a Dog class.
Then I use static_cast to convert the type from Dog* to Animal*, and assign the value to A2 with type Animal*
The conversion process is called **upcasting**
Aftet that, I try to call the function defined in the Animal class, who(). It prints out the following output:

> I'm an animal with ID 55

The reason why we can do this conversion between class is that Dog class is derived from Animal class. We definitely can't to the type conversion between random class.

Please noted, we can't access the variable or function defined in the derived class after upcasting. 

If I want to call the following function:

    A2->bark();
It will throw me the errors:

>E0135	class "Animal" has no member "bark"
>C2039	'bark': is not a member of 'Animal'

The errors clearly shows us that we are not allowed to access the variable or function defined in the derived class from the pointer to the base class (after upcasting)

Therefore, if we only want to use the variables and functions defined in the base class, upcasting is safe!

That is different from **downcasting**, which is not safe compared to **upcasting**

**Downcasting** is basically just an oppsite way to do type conversion, from the **pointer to base class** to the **pointer to derived class**.
I will not talk about it in the post. If you are interested, I can write another post in the future to focus on downcasting and show you more examples!

Thanks for reading!
